# Preparing for v1.0.0 Release

## Current Status
All necessary configurations for the v1.0.0 release are in place:

1. **Version**: The version in `package.json` is set to "1.0.0"
2. **GitHub Configuration**: The GitHub username and repository are correctly configured in `package.json`
3. **Release Notes**: `RELEASE_NOTES.md` is prepared with content for v1.0.0
4. **GitHub Actions**: Both `build.yml` and `release.yml` workflows are configured correctly
5. **Documentation**: The README.md includes instructions for creating releases

## Creating the v1.0.0 Release

To create your first release (v1.0.0), follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're on the `develop` branch with a clean working tree (which you currently have)
2. Create a release branch (following gitflow):
   ```
   git checkout -b release/1.0.0
   ```

3. Merge the release branch into master:
   ```
   git checkout master
   git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
   ```

4. Create and push the v1.0.0 tag:
   ```
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

5. Merge the changes back to develop:
   ```
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff master
   ```

6. Delete the release branch:
   ```
   git branch -d release/1.0.0
   ```

7. Push all branches:
   ```
   git push origin master
   git push origin develop
   ```

## What Happens Next

Once you push the v1.0.0 tag:

1. The `release.yml` workflow will automatically trigger
2. It will build the application for Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. It will create a GitHub Release with the version "1.0.0"
4. It will attach the built installers to the release
5. It will include the content from `RELEASE_NOTES.md` in the release description

You can monitor the progress in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

## Verifying the Release

After the workflow completes:

1. Go to the "Releases" section of your GitHub repository
2. You should see a new release titled "Release 1.0.0"
3. The release should include installers for all platforms
4. The release description should match the content of your `RELEASE_NOTES.md` file
